<h2>Lectures</h2>
<p><a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html">Professor Stanley Chan</a><br /> 
TuTh: 4:30pm-5:45pm Eastern Time<br /> 
Room: Zoom, meeting link available at Brightspace<br /> </p>
<p>For Spring 2021, I will do synchronous Zoom presentation for our lectures. 
This applies to both on-campus or off-campus students. Please do not go to 
Stewart Center 183. <br /></p>
<p>To encourage classroom participation, at this point I am not planning to 
record the live lectures. I will more or less follow my last year's schedule, 
and so you can watch the recorded videos if you cannot join the live lecture. 
If I teach anything new, I will record a new video and post it in 
Brightspace. <br /><br /> </p>
<h2>Course Description </h2>
<p>This is a graduate-level machine learning course at Purdue ECE. When I 
created the course in 2018, my vision is to do something different from what 
is already available on the internet (and other institutions). Perhaps 
needless to say, there is a tremendous demand for machine learning nowadays. 
However, if we go around the internet, it is indeed quite shocking to see the 
quality variation from one source to another. Many so-called data science 
courses on online platforms are more or less bubbles with no real content. 
Students who have taken these courses can only speak the jargon but cannot do 
any actual work. Great courses in some of our peer institutions are sometimes 
tailored to computer science Ph.D. students. For non-computer science 
students, the content may appear abstract. So I am seeing a need for 
engineering students, like ours at Purdue ECE. We need to develop a rigorous 
machine learning course, focus on the big pictures, and do something relevant 
to engineering students.  </p>
<p>So here comes our Purdue ECE595ML. It is a uniquely designed machine learning 
course for Purdue graduate students. The target audience group is engineering 
students with sufficient exposure to engineering problems, and have enough 
mathematical background to appreciate the depth. Engineering students are 
different from computer science students, in the sense that they are more 
interested in physics and intuitions than programming per se. To educate 
these students, big pictures and connections across different topics are more 
important than effcieint programming skills. Purdue ECE graduate students are 
also very solid in mathematics (Well, at least this is what I demand our 
Communication, Networking, Signal and Image Processing students). So, to feed 
their needs, we need to be rigorous. We need to explain the concepts to a 
point that they can carry over to their research/industry problems.  </p>
<p>Given the variety of materials in the literature, I have distilled a set of four fundamental 
machine learning topics that I believe every engineering student should be 
fluent at. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Mathematical preliminaries</b>. Matrices, vectors, Lp norm, geometry of the 
norms, symmetry, positive definiteness, eigen-decomposition. Unconstrained 
optimization, graident descent, convex functions, Lagrange multipliers, 
linear least squares. Probability space, random variables, joint 
distributions, multi-dimensional Gaussians.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Linear Classifiers</b>. Linear discriminant analysis, separating hyperplane, 
multi-class classification, Bayesian decision rule, geometry of Bayesian 
decision rule, linear regression, logistic regression, perceptron algorithms, 
support vector machines, nonlinear transformations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Learning Theory</b>. Bias and variance, training and testing, generalization, 
PAC framework, Hoeffding inequality, VC dimension.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Robustness</b>. Adversarial attack, targeted and untargeted attack, minimum 
distance attack, maximum loss attack, regularization-based attack. 
Perturbation through noies. Robustness of SVM. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that after you have taken this course, you will become a different 
person than someone who took an online bubble course. I hope that you will be 
able to confidently speak about the principles behind the machine learning 
tools. And more importantly, I hope that you will be able to understand the 
limitations of machine learning tools. Since the first offering in 2018, the 
course has received enormous positive feedback. Students generally find the 
course a very different learning experience than other machine learning 
courses they have taken. </p>
<p>Remark for Spring 2021: I may modify some of the lectures, by removing a few and adding some new ones. Stay in tune on this. <br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2>Pre-requisites </h2>
<p>I understand the huge demand for taking a machine learning course nowadays. 
However, ECE595ML may not be suitable for everyone. If you are not our 
Communication, Networking, Signal, and Image Processing (CNSIP) graduate 
students, you may want to check the pre-requisites below to see if you are 
ready to take the course. Historically speaking, students without proper 
mathematics background (e.g., students from a non-engineering school) have 
found this course difficult. If you are not ready, I would recommend you 
consider taking a few pre-requisite courses before attempting ECE595ML. </p>

<p>To help you determine if you have adequate pre-requisites, we encourage you 
to try homework 0:</p>
<p>Homework 0: <a href="./files/homework0.pdf">(PDF) 230KB</a></p>
<p>If you can finish all the problems without hacking (you know what I mean by 
hacking), you are fine.  <br /><br /><br /></p>
<h2>Grades </h2>
<p>All students will be graded by the rubrics listed below. Everyone (PhD, MS, 
online MS, undergrad) will be graded on the same curve. If you choose Pass-No 
Pass, you still need to do everything. If you are above the cut off, you will 
pass. There is no audit for Spring 2021 due to Zoom security.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Homework (10%). There are six homeworks. I will drop the worst one. Each 
homework will have 2 points: If you complete the homework, you get 2. If you 
are partially done with the homework, you get 1. If you do not submit, you 
get 0. I do not accept late homework. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Quiz (40%). There will be six quizzes. I will drop the worst one. Each 
quiz is 30 minutes long. Each quiz will carry 8%. The quizzes are conducted 
right after the due date of the homework. You will be given a 24-hour window 
to complete the 30-min quiz, completely online. During the quiz, I will ask 
you lecture questions. I will also ask you homework questions. For example, 
if in the homework I ask you to plot a figure, I may ask you to change a 
parameter and re-plot the figure. Quizzes will be open-book, open-note, 
open-computer. However, with only 30 minutes, you probably will not have time 
to read anything besides answering the questions. So, please do the homework.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Final Project (50%). Due Apr 30. I will give you a list of papers and 
topics you can choose from. After you have picked a topic, I will ask you to 
complete several tasks. The tasks will involve extending the paper, or 
proposing something new. I will grade your report according to the general 
standard in ICML, NeurISP, CVPR, and ICCV. Think of that we are reviewers for 
your papers.  <br /><br /><br /> </p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>We will be primarily using <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. As such, I 
expect you to have elementary programming skills, e.g., writing a hello world 
program. More information and resources on how to use Python can be found in 
the <a href="./python.html">programming</a> section of this website. I found 
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab</a> a fairly easy-to-use 
platform for Python programming. You can check this out. <br /><br /> </p>
<p>Besides Python, we use optimization packages to solve optimization problems. 
Of particular importance is <a href="http://cvxr.com/cvx/">CVX</a>. <br /><br /><br /></p>
